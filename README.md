# Assignment 10: 

This assignment explores methods for reconstructing space, shape, and geometry from multiple images of a scene using [OpenSfM](https://github.com/mapillary/OpenSfM) package -- an open source Structure from Motion library built on top of OpenCV.  This library is already installed on the course VM.
